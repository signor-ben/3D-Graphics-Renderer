# C++ OpenGL 3D Renderer  

## Project Overview  

A custom 3D renderer built in C++ using OpenGL, featuring real-time shading, lighting, and interactive camera controls. This project implements essential graphics techniques, including vertex and fragment shaders (GLSL), depth buffering, and rasterization, to efficiently render polygonal objects.  

### Key Features  
- **Custom Shading & Lighting** – Real-time rendering with GLSL shaders.  
- **3D Transformations** – Translation, rotation, and scaling for object manipulation.  
- **Depth Buffering & Rasterization** – Ensures correct object rendering.  
- **Interactive Camera System** – Move and rotate the camera for scene exploration.  
- **OpenGL Context Management** – Powered by GLFW and GLAD.

## Instructions to Run the Code  

### 1. Requirements  
- OpenGL  
- GLFW  
- GLAD  
- CMake (for building)  
- A C++17-compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)  

### 2. Building and Running  

#### **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```
#### **Build the project using CMake**
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
#### **Run the executable**

## Known Issues
Some systems may require installing additional OpenGL dependencies.
May need to manually build the vscpkg using the .bat file.
